#Fix the invalid variable names in the code below. Python follows similar rules: variables can contain letters, numbers, and _, but cannot start with numbers, contain hyphens, or use reserved words.

student = "Alice"
user_name = "bob123"
subject = "Python"
total_marks = 95
a = "Hello"

print(student)
print(user_name)
print(subject)
print(total_marks)
print(a)
