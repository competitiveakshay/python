# Write a Python program that implements a Triangle Analyzer. The program should read three positive integers a, b, c (the side lengths) and checks if they can form a triangle .

# Valid Triangle Conditions:

# (a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a).

# If the triangle is not valid, print "Invalid triangle".

# If the triangle is valid, classify it by sides (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) and by angles (Right-angled, Acute, or Obtuse). Finally, print both classifications on one line.

# For example, if the input is 3 4 5, the output should be "Scalene Right-angled". If the input is 2 2 3, the output should be "Isosceles Acute".
